## Usage

### Processing Payments

To process a payment, make a `POST` request to `/process-payment` with the payment details in the request body.

```http
POST /process-payment
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "paymentId": "unique_payment_id",
  "amount": 100,
  "currency": "USD",
  "merchantWalletAddress": "merchant_wallet_address",
  "customerWalletAddress": "customer_wallet_address"
}
```

### Retrieving Payment Details

To retrieve payment details, make a `GET` request to `/payment/{paymentId}` where `{paymentId}` is the unique ID of the payment.

```http
GET /payment/{paymentId}
```

### Webhook Configuration

To configure webhooks for receiving real-time payment notifications, make a `POST` request to `/webhooks`.

```http
POST /webhooks
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "url": "https://yourwebhookurl.com",
  "events": ["payment_success", "payment_failure"]
}
```

### Listing Payments

To list payments with optional filtering based on merchant ID, start date, and end date, make a `GET` request to `/payments`.

```http
GET /payments?merchantId=your_merchant_id&startDate=2023-01-01&endDate=2023-12-31
```

### Refunding Payments

To initiate a refund for a previously processed payment, make a `POST` request to `/refund-payment` with the payment ID in the request body.

```http
POST /refund-payment
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "paymentId": "payment_to_refund_id"
}
```

## Configuration

Configure your Solana network and API settings in the `config.js` file.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  solanaRpcUrl: 'https://api.mainnet.solana.com', // Replace with your Solana network URL
  alchemyRpcUrl: 'https://solana-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/e_k2llhrt6iS-TxTwKFyfru1iDgeH1eF', // Replace with your Alchemy RPC URL
  // Other configuration settings
};
```
