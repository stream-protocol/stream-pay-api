## StreamPay API (Swagger) Doc

To implement these improvements in Swagger, follow these steps:

1. **Consistency in Descriptions:**
   Review and update descriptions for each endpoint and parameter to ensure clarity and consistency.

2. **Examples:**
   Add examples for each parameter and response object. Here is an example of how to add examples to your Swagger doc:

   ```yaml
   paths:
     /process-payment:
       post:
         summary: Process a payment
         description: Process a payment through StreamPay's system.
         parameters:
           - name: paymentId
             in: body
             description: Unique ID of the payment.
             required: true
             schema:
               type: string
               example: "abcd1234"
           # ... (other parameters)
         responses:
           200:
             description: Confirmation of the processed payment.
             schema:
               type: object
               properties:
                 message:
                   type: string
                   example: "Payment processed successfully"
                 paymentId:
                   type: string
                   example: "abcd1234"
   ```

3. **Error Responses:**
   Add common error responses for each endpoint:

   ```yaml
   responses:
     400:
       description: Bad Request
       schema:
         $ref: '#/definitions/Error'
     401:
       description: Unauthorized
       schema:
         $ref: '#/definitions/Error'
     404:
       description: Not Found
       schema:
         $ref: '#/definitions/Error'
     500:
       description: Internal Server Error
       schema:
         $ref: '#/definitions/Error'
   ```

4. **Security Schemes:**
   Add details about the security schemes supported:

   ```yaml
   securityDefinitions:
     APIKeyAuth:
       type: apiKey
       in: header
       name: Authorization
   ```

5. **Tags and Sorting:**
   Use tags to group related endpoints together:

   ```yaml
   tags:
     - name: Payments
       description: Endpoints related to payments
   paths:
     /process-payment:
       post:
         tags:
           - Payments
         # ... (other endpoint details)
   ```

6. **Versioning:**
   Add versioning to your API:

   ```yaml
   basePath: /v1/streampay
   ```

7. **Additional Metadata:**
   Include additional metadata:

   ```yaml
   info:
     contact:
       name: StreamPay Support
       email: support@streampay.com
     license:
       name: MIT
       url: https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT
     termsOfService: https://streampay.com/terms
   ```

8. **External Documentation:**
   Include a link to external documentation:

   ```yaml
   externalDocs:
     description: Find out more about StreamPay
     url: https://streampay.com/docs
   ```

After making these changes, review and test Swagger documentation to ensure that it is comprehensive, user-friendly, and valuable to developers.
